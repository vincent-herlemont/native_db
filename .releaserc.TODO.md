# TODO: Re-enable 0.8.x branch releases

After version 0.9.0 is released on the main branch, re-enable the 0.8.x maintenance branch in `.releaserc` by updating the branches configuration:

```json
"branches": [
  "main",
  {
    "name": "0.8.x"
  }
],
```

This was temporarily disabled to avoid the semantic-release version range conflict error that occurs when both main and 0.8.x branches have the same version (0.8.1).
